To do manual by alejandroalzate: Create your own minecraft server.
To unexperimented people make your own minecraft server.
1. First create an folder to store your server BUT don't fill it with NOTHING!. Can be this example '~\server\'
2. Download the version for your own preference from file.minecraftforge.net find the 'installer flavour' (If not download the lastest-stable I recommend when create the modtd for the server specify the version the 90% of people have the lastest-stable version)
if you are using linux remember enable the executable bit of all .jar files on:
Options/Right Click > Propieties > Permissions > allow execute the file
3. Intall java if doesn't have it and run the downloaded file wait while appears the window
Windows representation (to see this correctly make -50% zoom out):
